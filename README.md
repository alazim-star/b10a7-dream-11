### description about react use
1. Component-Based Architecture:

React is based on components—reusable, isolated pieces of code that define parts of the UI. Each component manages its own content, layout, and behavior.
Components can be reused and nested, allowing developers to build complex UIs from smaller, manageable pieces.

2. React Hooks:

Hooks (such as useState and useEffect) enable developers to use state and lifecycle features in functional components, which were previously only possible in class components.

3. State and Props:

State: The data that changes over time within a component, managed internally.
Props: Short for properties, props allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child component, ensuring a unidirectional data flow.

4. One-Way Data Binding:

Data flows in a single direction (from parent to child components), making it easier to understand data changes and reducing the risk of unexpected errors.




### Technologies used
In this project, building a Player Selection App for a sports team. The app includes a few main features:

`#RRGGBB`Available Players List: Displays a list of all available players. Users can add players to their selection from here, with a limit of up to 6 players.

`#RRGGBB`Selected Players: Shows the players the user has selected, displaying basic information like name, batting hand, and bowling hand, along with the option to remove players.

`#RRGGBB`Credit Management: Users can add credits and are alerted when there is insufficient credit to select a player.

`#RRGGBB`Notifications: Uses react-toastify to show notifications, informing users when a player is added, if they've reached the selection limit, or if a player is already selected.

`#RRGGBB`Navigation: Includes a toggle between the "Available" and "Selected" player views, with active states styled accordingly.

### 3 key features of project
