3 key features of your project.


In this project, building a Player Selection App for a sports team. The app includes a few main features:

Available Players List: Displays a list of all available players. Users can add players to their selection from here, with a limit of up to 6 players.

Selected Players: Shows the players the user has selected, displaying basic information like name, batting hand, and bowling hand, along with the option to remove players.

Credit Management: Users can add credits and are alerted when there is insufficient credit to select a player.

Notifications: Uses react-toastify to show notifications, informing users when a player is added, if they've reached the selection limit, or if a player is already selected.

Navigation: Includes a toggle between the "Available" and "Selected" player views, with active states styled accordingly.
